always create separate classes for CTk, CTkToplevel or CTkFrame.

(UpperCamelCase) Class names:
should generally follow the UpperCamelCase convention, also known as PascalCase.
Example: class MyClass:

(snake_case) Function and Method Names:
should also be in lowercase and, if necessary, separated by underscores.
Example: def my_function():

(snake_case) Variable Names:
should be in lowercase and, if necessary, separated by underscores. This convention is the most common in Python.
Example: my_variable = 10

(UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES) Constant Names:
variables whose values are not expected to change, should be in UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES.
Example: MAX_SIZE = 100

(_* or __*) Private and Protected Members:
should start with a single underscore (_), indicating that they are intended for internal use only. Protected members should start with a double underscore (__).
Example: self._private_variable = 10

Module Names:
should be short and descriptive, and they should be in lowercase if possible. Avoid using underscores in module names unless necessary.
Example: import my_module

Package Names:
should be all lowercase and avoid underscores. They should be short and descriptive.
Example: import mypackage

Avoid Using Single-Character Names:
Unless they represent simple iterators (e.g., i, j, k), avoid using single-character names for variables, functions, or parameters. Use descriptive names to enhance readability.
